How to use Nordic Power profiling kit with nRF91 DK

There are several ways to measure current on the nRF91 development kit (nRF91-DK) using various test equipment like Power analyzer, Oscilloscope, and Ampere-meter. All of them use the same connector with some external hardware and that is quite well explained in the Nordic documentation section ["Measuring current" of the nRF9160][currnet_mes]. Because we want to use Nordic Power Profiling Kit (nRF-PPK) with nRF91-DK we need to think of it as an external power supply case form the Nordic nRF91-DK documentation. 
The picture below shows the connection between nRF-PPK and nRF91-DK.
